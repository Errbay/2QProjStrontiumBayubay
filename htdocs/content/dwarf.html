         <p class="center float">Aule was an artistic Valar, due to this, he developed several techniques and crafts granting the name Aule the Smith. With this in mind, he wanted people to show and teach these crafts to and thus he impatiently created the dwarves without Eru Iluvitar’s permission. Upon the creation, Eru would clearly be disappointed. Realizing his mistake, he decided to kill his seven creations, later to be known as the Fathers of the Dwarves. The dwarves begged and cowered for mercy and Eru who felt sympathy adopted them as his own children. He put them to sleep only to be awoken after the Elves.

         <p class="center">Dwarves were artistic people clearly influenced by their father, Aule’s, nature. Due to this, they built massive halls underground with the most expensive stone they can find and exceptional detail work with no reason other than to appreciate its beauty. Dwarves are not considered full-grown until the age of 30 thus they are exempt from war and hard labor, an example of this is how Gimli son of Gloin was not allowed to join Thorin’s company due to “only” being 62 years old. 
         <br>Other Free People’s thought of the Dwarves as exceptionally stubborn and secretive although hardy warriors backed up by their exceptional gear which they themselves create. They breed slowly as only a third of their population is composed of women.</p>

         <p class="center">Dwarves were short in comparison to the Men and Elves of Middle Earth, on average being about 4 feet 5 inches tall. They were of a stocky build and distinctive beards including women, dwarves also never go bald.</p>

         <h2 class="center" id="individuals">Notable individuals (third age)</h2>

         <h3 class="center">Thorin II son of Thrain II</h3>
         <p class="center clearfix">More prominently known as Thorin Oakenshield, the rightful King Under the Mountain, and the King of Durin’s folk. Thorin was still young when Smaug invaded Erebor and 171 years later, went to reclaim lands that rightfully belong to him. He and his company which also included Gandalf and Frodo Baggins successfully defeated Smaug thus reclaiming his title as the King under the Mountain. During the Battle of the Five Armies, Thorin brought together the Free People of Middle Earth to fight against the Orcs and Goblins, Thorin amasses a mortal injury and dies afterward.</p> 

         <h3 class="center">The Dwarves of Thorin’s Company</h3>
         <p class="center clearfix">Thorin II brought a company of twelve dwarves with him to reclaim Erebor. Namely they are, Fili, Kili, Gloin, Oin, Dori, Nori, Ori, Dwalin, Balin, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur.</p> 

         <h3 class="center">Gimli son of Gloin</h3>
         <p class="center clearfix">A member of the Fellowship, Gimli was a fearsome warrior who was adept at almost every weapon. Much like Legolas, his great friend, he accomplished little during the War of the Ring in the grand scheme of things. His greatest contribution during the time was leading Gandalf through the mines of Moria due to his innate ability of underground navigation. After the war, Gimli fashioned the glittering caves of Aglarond where he made a colony of dwarves and became the First Lord of the Glittering Caves.</p>
