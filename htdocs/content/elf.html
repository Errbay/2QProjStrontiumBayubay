         <h2 class="center" id="creation">Creation</h2>

         <p class="center float">Known as the firstborn due to being the first children of Eru Iluvitar to awaken. They cannot be killed by disease or aging but only through physical injuries. The Elves were created not long after the stars but before the moon and sun. The first Elves awoke in the Lake of Cuivienen.

         <p class="center">Elves were known as the wisest and fairest amongst the Children of Iluvitar. Due to their near-immortality, Elves had little lust and thus married once only due to a supposed true love. When Elves marry, their souls intertwine and thus their fates are connected. Their minds grew quickly but their bodies did not, they are considered full-grown by the age of a century but reach physical maturity by the age of 50. When elves die, their souls are connected to Arda and thus stay there until the end of Arda. Most Elves reside in the land west of Middle-Earth, Valinor, separated by a vast ocean where the Ainur reside and is considered an Elven paradise.</p>

         <h2 class="center" id="physical">Physical Features</h2>

         <p class="center">Elves did not look much different than their brothers, the men. Their differences were more of a generality. Elves were slightly taller than men on average with varying hair colors just like men. Though there was no mention of the inexistence of dark-skinned elves, all the notable elves were described and drawn with fair skin. Elves were described to either have blue or grey eye colors. Elves are also known for their heightened senses and nimbleness.

         <h2 class="center" id="individuals">Notable individuals (third age)</h2>

         <h3 class="center">Elrond son of Earendil</h3>
         <p class="center clearfix">Elrond the Half-Elven was one of the main figures to oppose Sauron during the Second Age fighting alongside Gil-galad in the War of the Last Alliance. During the Third Age, he married Celebrian who left for The Undying Lands due to a mortal wound untreatable in Middle-Earth. His main duty during the time was to take care of the heirs of Isildur, most notably Aragorn II son of Arathorn. He resided in Rivendell where he formed the Fellowship of the Ring during the Council of Elrond.</p> 

         <h3 class="center">Galadriel daughter of Finarfin</h3>
         <p class="center clearfix">The Lady of Lothlorien, the spouse of Celeborn, and the bearer of the ring Nenya. Considered one of the strongest and wisest remaining Elves in Middle-Earth. Galadriel and her spouse Celeborn welcomed the Fellowship to their land of Lothlorien where she gave them several gifts and equipment to aid them in their travels. To aid the hobbits specifically, she let them peer into her mirror to see what may or may not lay ahead of their journeys. As a reminder of her beauty, Gimli son of Gloin was bewildered by the lady’s beauty and poise despite being an Elf. In contrast, Celeborn was weary of the Dwarf’s entrance into his lands.</p> 

         <h3 class="center">Legolas son of Thranduil</h3>
         <p class="center clearfix">A member of the Fellowship, he was an expert archer. Due to his keen senses, he acted as a rearguard during their travels to destroy the ring. Throughout their travels, his relationship with Gimli son of Gloin grew until they would be considered great friends, so much so that he journeyed with him to reach Valinor after the ring’s destruction. In the grand scheme of things, Legolas accomplished very little during the War of the Ring.</p> 

         <h3 class="center">Glorfindel, the Lord of the Golden Flower</h3>
         <p class="center clearfix">A warrior of legends and regarded as one if not the mightiest elf to ever live. Glorfindel met his demise when escaping from Gothmog during the long war against Melkor where he and his company were faced against a Balrog. Astoundingly, Glorfindel fought the Balrog in a duel which ended in both his and the Balrog’s demise. He was later reincarnated during the second age. During the third age, he and his men fought off the witch king which led to the latter’s retreat. During the war of the ring, Glorfindel was sent to deliver Frodo and company to Rivendell. He fought off the Nazgul on his way and upon finding the hobbits, led them to Rivendell. When the Nazguls caught up, he gave the hobbits his steed which led them to Rivendell.</p>
