         <h2 class="center" id="creation">Creation</h2>

         <p class="center float">Not much is known about the creation of Hobbits. Due to their similarities in build to humans and lack of particularly special characteristics, some speculate they are a close “breed” of humans. They lived in total seclusion from the other stronger races until being found in the early third age at the Vales of Anduin. </p>

         <h2 class="center" id="lifestyle">Lifestyle</h2>

         <p class="center">As seen by how they were only found in the Third Age despite living for generations before, Hobbits lived very quiet and rural lives. Their general lifestyle changes from which type of hobbit they are. 
         <br>The Harfoots were the most common and burrowed underground which we know as Hobbit-Holes, this later on became the predominant way of living. Harfoots had hairy feet and thus did not use any footwear. 
         <br>The Stoors were riverside people and the only breed of Hobbits who had a large colony outside the Shire. Stoors were known for being able to swim and build boats, while relying on fish and agriculture as a source of food. They also had friendly relations with men.
         <br>The Fallohides were known as hunters and thus lived in forests. They were the rarest of Hobbits and considered better leaders. They were the most fluent in literature arts and song and due to these many characteristics became friendly with Elves. 
         <br>Upon landing on the Shire, Hobbits interbred and thus breeds essentially ceased to exist besides the aforementioned Stoors.</p>

         <h2 class="center" id="physical">Physical Features</h2>

         <p class="center"> Hobbits were very short individuals and thus gaining the name, Halflings. They were on average 3 feet 6 inches tall and had large hands and feet. 
         <br>Harfoots had darker skin than the rest of the hobbits and hairy feet which gained them their name. They were the shortest of the hobbits.
         <br>Stoors were the bulkiest of the hobbits and would commonly grow facial hair which gained them a resemblance to Men.
         <br>Fallohides were the tallest and fairest of the hobbits.</p>

         <h2 class="center" id="individuals">Notable individuals (third age)</h2>
         
         <h3 class="center">Frodo Baggins son of Drogo Baggins</h3>
         <p class="center clearfix">The ring bearer and the protagonist of the Lord of the Rings. Much is to say about Frodo Baggins but all you must know is that he carried the weight of the ring and avoided temptation until destroying it in Mount Doom. Going into a deep depression due to the Scouring, he, later on, traveled to Valinor where he lived the rest of his days.</p> 

         <h3 class="center">Bilbo Baggins son of Bungo Baggins</h3>
         <p class="center clearfix">Bilbo accompanied Thorin and Gandalf toward Erebor due to his hobbit nature which would prove useful in stealth. While traveling to Erebor, he stumbled upon Gollum in the caves of the Misty Mountains where he found the one ring and stole it. After a long journey, they succeeded in regaining Erebor. After the Battle of Five Armies, which he did not participate in and found grotesque, he gained a large number of riches which he brought to the Shire to live with the ring. During his 111th birthday, he reluctantly gives the ring to Frodo under Gandalf’s bidding and left for a journey. He lived in Rivendell for 20 years before sailing west with Frodo and company.</p> 

         <h3 class="center">Faramir son of Denethor II</h3>
         <p class="center clearfix">Faramir is the younger son of Denethor II and is the captain of the Rangers of Ithilien and later on the heir of the stewardship of Gondor once his brother, Boromir, died. Faramir, as a person, is a contrast to his brother’s live, daring, and war-hungry nature. Faramir was a man who loved music and arts, as well as being a quiet man. He was a masterful war tactician known for his stealthy style of war although ultimately disliked violence. He, later on, married Eowyn of Rohan.</p> 

         <h3 class="center">Samwise Gamgee son of Gaffer Gamgee</h3>
         <p class="center clearfix">A member of the Fellowship and Frodo’s trusted friend and Gardener. Samwise accompanied Frodo towards Mount Doom the entire way saving Frodo a multitude of times. The most significant of these is when Samwise singlehandedly killed Shelob after seeing his supposedly dead friend. He held the ring with him with the intention of continuing on the journey to destroy it without his friend. He found Frodo alive and well shortly after and gave the ring back readily which proves the mental fortitude of Samwise. After the scouring, he and Frodo left for Valinor where they lived in peace.</p> 

         <h3 class="center">Smeagol</h3>
         <p class="center clearfix">Later on, called Gollum was a Stoor and possessor of the One Ring after killing his friend Deagol in a river for it. Due to the ring, he lived an extremely extended life under the misty mountains where he succumbed completely to the Ring and reached insanity. He lost the ring to Bilbo Baggins. After searching for the ring and being captured by Mordor, Smeagol met Frodo and Samwise and tried to help them reach Mordor to dispose of the ring. He gathered some sanity due to losing the ring and wanted to help the next ring bearer. Frodo gave Smeagol to Faramir which caused Smeagol to go back to his past habits due to feeling betrayed. In the end, in pursuit of revenge and the One Ring, he fell into Mount Doom to perish with his beloved ring.</p> 

         <h3 class="center">Marco and Blanco </h3>
         <p class="center clearfix">Two Fallohide brothers who led a large group of Hobbits towards a settlement which was later called the Shire.</p> 

         <h3 class="center">Bandobras Took</h3>
         <p class="center clearfix">Essentially the only known warrior of the Hobbits’ written history, Bandobras led the shire in defending against a group of goblins. He slew the goblin leader in a duel and successfully protected peace within the shire.</p>
