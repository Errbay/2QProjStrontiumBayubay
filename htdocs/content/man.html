         <h2 class="center" id="creation">Creation</h2>

         <p class="center float">The Men of Ea was the second race created by the supreme being,Eru Ilúvatar. They awoke during the start of the first age three ages after the Elves. In contrast to the elves who were given immortality in the sense that even when they die, their souls linger in Arda awaiting the fall of the world, Eru gave Men the gift of Men. 
         <br>The gift of Men is the promise that when a man is slain, their soul loses connection to Arda and is sent to an unknown land which only Eru knows the details of.

         <h2 class="center" id="lifestyle">Lifestyle</h2>

         <p class="center">Due to men having the shortest lifespan amongst the many races, they were known for a “rushed” lifestyle due to wanting to do more within their shorter lives. This is the reason why they were easily manipulated by Morgoth and Sauron as seen by how Boromir was easily corrupted by the one ring due to his knowledge of the ring’s potential war power despite being a very noble man. Because men seek power and live their lives in a relatively “rushed” fashion, they were the most spread out across middle earth.</p>

         <h2 class="center" id="physical">Physical Features</h2>

         <p class="center">Men used to be divided between two groups:
         <br>Numenoreans, the men who fought alongside the Elves in the first age, usually had golden hair and blue eyes. The Numenorean men were extremely tall people with an average height of 6 foot 4 inches
         <br>And Easterlings who had varying skin tones and heights. They generally had dark eyes and hair.
         <br>Physically, Men were the strongest free people after the towering Ents. They were also generally buffer than the Elves.

         <h2 class="center" id="individuals">Notable individuals (third age)</h2>

         <h3 class="center">Aragorn II son of Arathorn</h3>
         <p class="center clearfix">Aragorn, a member of the Fellowship of the Ring, the heir of Isildur and Gondor, and later the High King of Gondor where he is named King Elessar Telcontar. His coronation as the High King is one of the main marking points of the fourth age, also known as the age of men. He is also the titular character of the third part of the LOTR trilogy, The Return of The King.</p> 

         <h3 class="center">Boromir son of Denethor II</h3>
         <p class="center clearfix">Another member of the Fellowship of the Ring, Boromir was a benevolent and righteous man so much so that he was the Aragorn’s most trusted friend and ally until Boromir’s subsequent death. Boromir was in every way a man of war and was praised by his peers for this. Throughout his travels with the Fellowship, he believed that the ring should be used in order to defeat Sauron in battle instead of destroying it. With the lust for the ring’s capabilities in war, Boromir was ultimately corrupted by the ring which led to him sacrificing himself in order to save his friends.</p> 

         <h3 class="center">Faramir son of Denethor II</h3>
         <p class="center clearfix">Faramir is the younger son of Denethor II and is the captain of the Rangers of Ithilien and later on the heir of the stewardship of Gondor once his brother, Boromir, died. Faramir, as a person, is a contrast to his brother’s live, daring, and war-hungry nature. Faramir was a man who loved music and arts, as well as being a quiet man. He was a masterful war tactician known for his stealthy style of war although ultimately disliked violence. He, later on, married Eowyn of Rohan.</p> 

         <h3 class="center">Bard the First</h3>
         <p class="center clearfix">Known for his yew bow, he is more notably known as Bard the Bowman. Bard was a man of Lake-town during the time when Smaug resided in the Lonely Mountain. He helped Bilbo Baggins through his adventure and when Smaug flew out of his mountain, Bard shot his black arrow into the dragon’s weak point and ultimately killed it. After this event, Bard was crowned the king of Dale where he was named Bard the First.</p> 

         <h3 class="center">Eomer Eadig son of Eumund</h3>
         <p class="center clearfix">The Third Marshal of The Riddermark and the eventual Eighteenth King of Rohan after his uncle, Theoden’s, death. As the Lord of the Mark, he and Aragorn led the men of Rohan in the resistance of the Uruk-hai in the Battle of Helm’s Deep.</p> 

         <h3 class="center">Grima Wormtongue son of Galmod</h3>
         <p class="center clearfix">Grima was the Chief Advisor to Theoden and a subsequent mole when he was ensnared by Saruman. As Saruman’s puppet, Grima manipulated Theoden until he was found out and sent to exile. He stayed in Orthanc with his master, Saruman, witnessing their overwhelming loss at the Battle of Isengard. Later on, he backstabbed Saruman due to hatred. While escaping was killed by hobbit arrows.</p> 

         <h3 class="center">Theoden son of Tengel</h3>
         <p class="center clearfix">The seventeenth King of Rohan and the previous Lord of the Mark. During his 40 year rule, Theoden was gradually misled by Grima Wormtongue to the point where he essentially became a puppet king to Saruman. He was a sickly man due to Grima Wormtongue’s assumed poisoning. Gandalf cured Theoden of Grima’s manipulation. During the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, Theoden led 6 thousand men to face Sauron’s forces. He challenged the Witch King and the Nine but was mortally wounded when his steed collapsed upon him.</p>
